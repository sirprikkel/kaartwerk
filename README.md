MapToPoster JS is a client-side web application designed to generate high-resolution map posters. It allows users to search for any location in the world and transform it into a piece of art with customizable themes, layouts, and export formats.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Dual Rendering Engine**: 
  - **Standard Mode**: Efficient tile-based mapping powered by Leaflet, supporting various base map styles (Minimal, Dark, Satellite, Voyager).
  - **Artistic Mode**: Vector-based procedural themes powered by MapLibre GL, offering unique styles like Arctic Frost, Aurora Glow, Cyber Glitch, and more.
- **Global Search**: Find any city or landmark worldwide via Nominatim API.
- **Dynamic Composition**: 
  - Real-time perspective and zoom controls.
  - Customizable poster overlays (Size, Background opacity).
  - Geographic coordinate display.
- **High-Resolution Export**: Export your creations as high-quality PNG files with preset sizes (A4, Instagram, Stories) or custom pixel dimensions.
- **Persistent Settings**: Your preferences and last viewed location are automatically saved to local storage.
- **Privacy Focused**: All rendering and data processing happen entirely on the client-side.

## 🎨 Themes

MapToPoster JS offers two distinct ways to style your maps:

### Standard Themes (Leaflet)
Based on high-quality raster tiles from established providers:
- **Minimal White**: Clean and modern (CartoDB Positron).
- **Midnight Dark**: Sleek dark mode (CartoDB Dark Matter).
- **Classic Street**: Standard OpenStreetMap cartography.
- **Modern Voyager**: Colorful and detailed (CartoDB Voyager).
- **Satellite View**: High-resolution imagery (Esri World Imagery).

### Artistic Themes (MapLibre GL)
Hand-crafted vector styles with procedural colors:
- **Arctic Frost**: Pale blues and crisp whites.
- **Aurora Glow**: Iridescent greens and pinks.
- **Cyber Glitch**: Neon accents for a digital look.
- **Paper Heritage**: Vintage sepia tones and inked roads.
- **Volcanic Ash**: Deep charcoal with glowing ember accents.

### Customizing Themes
You can easily add your own artistic themes by editing [src/core/artistic-themes.js](src/core/artistic-themes.js):

1. Open `artistic-themes.js`.
2. Add a new object to the `artisticThemes` export:
```javascript
your_theme_key: {
    name: "Your Theme Name",
    description: "Brief description of the style",
    bg: "#HEXCODE",           // Page/Background color
    text: "#HEXCODE",         // Labels and text color
    water: "#HEXCODE",        // Rivers, lakes, and oceans
    parks: "#HEXCODE",        // Green spaces and forests
    road_motorway: "#HEXCODE",
    road_primary: "#HEXCODE",
    road_secondary: "#HEXCODE",
    road_default: "#HEXCODE"
}
```
The application will automatically pick up the new theme and display it in the selection menu.

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Optimized files will be generated in the `dist/` folder.

## 📜 Technical Overview

1. **State Management**: A reactive state store in `src/core/state.js` synchronizes changes between the UI and both map engines.
2. **Synchronized Viewports**: The Leaflet and MapLibre viewports are bidirectionally synced, ensuring consistency regardless of which interface is being manipulated.
3. **Capture Logic**: High-fidelity exports are achieved by scaling the map containers to the target resolution before rendering with `html2canvas` or internal GL buffers.
